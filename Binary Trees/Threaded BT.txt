We solved some examples of the various traversals 

DFS: inorder,postorder,preorder
BFS: level order

In such traversals be it iterative or recursive some amount 
of space is always allocated and thus a need of a variant was
required. A threaded bt is a variant of bt which basically 
makes each node of a bt to point to its inorder predecessor or
successor of it.

It can be of two types:

Single: 

In such a case the node is made to point either to its
predecessor or sucessor.

Double:

In such a case the node is made to point to both ie. 
the predecessor and the sucessor.
