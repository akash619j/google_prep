//given a bst find the minimum value in it.

/*

The idea is to traverse the bst visiting
its left subtree for each node until we
reach a NULL. The last visited node along 
the left subtree is the minimum value of
the given bst.

*/


Code:

int minBST(node* root)
{
	node* curr=root;
	
	while(curr->left!=NULL)
		curr=curr->left;
	return curr->val;
}
